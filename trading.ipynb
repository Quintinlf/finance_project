    "# 📊 Complete Trading System Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This is your **comprehensive automated paper trading system** that combines:\n",
    "- **Bayesian Machine Learning** for probabilistic forecasting\n",
    "- **Gaussian Processes** for non-linear pattern recognition  \n",
    "- **Technical Analysis** (RSI) for market sentiment\n",
    "- **Real-time Alpaca API** for paper trading execution\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 The 5 W's + H\n",
    "\n",
    "### **WHO** uses this system?\n",
    "- **You** - retail trader using algorithmic strategies\n",
    "- **Target**: Any trader wanting quantitative, probability-based trading decisions\n",
    "- **Skill Level**: Intermediate Python + understanding of basic statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "### **WHAT** does it do?\n",
    "1. **Downloads** historical stock data (Yahoo Finance)\n",
    "2. **Analyzes** price movements using 3 independent models:\n",
    "   - Bayesian Linear Regression\n",
    "   - Gaussian Process Regression\n",
    "   - RSI Technical Indicator\n",
    "3. **Generates** trading signals (BUY/SELL/HOLD) with confidence scores\n",
    "4. **Executes** paper trades via Alpaca API with automated bracket orders (take-profit + stop-loss)\n",
    "5. **Manages** positions with risk controls\n",
    "\n",
    "### **WHEN** to use it?\n",
    "- **During market hours** (DAY orders execute when market opens if submitted after hours)\n",
    "- **Daily/Weekly**: Run scheduled scans of your universe\n",
    "- **Before trading**: Generate signals and review recommendations\n",
    "- **Real-time**: Monitor positions and adjust thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "### **WHERE** does it connect?\n",
    "- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance (yfinance library) - free historical data\n",
    "- **Broker**: Alpaca Markets API (paper trading account - no real money)\n",
    "- **Execution**: Cloud-ready (can run on local machine or server)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **WHY** this approach?\n",
    "✅ **Probabilistic**: Every prediction includes uncertainty (confidence intervals)  \n",
    "✅ **Multi-model**: Combines 3 independent approaches = more robust  \n",
    "✅ **Automated**: Removes emotional decision-making  \n",
    "✅ **Risk-managed**: Bracket orders = automatic profit-taking + loss-limiting  \n",
    "✅ **Paper trading**: Test strategies without risking real capital  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **HOW** does it work?\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. DATA COLLECTION → yfinance downloads historical prices\n",
    "2. FEATURE ENGINEERING → Creates lagged returns, volatility, RSI\n",
    "3. MODEL 1: Bayesian Linear Regression → Predicts next return using weighted averages\n",
    "4. MODEL 2: Gaussian Process → Captures non-linear patterns in price history\n",
    "5. MODEL 3: RSI Analysis → Bayesian interpretation of oversold/overbought levels\n",
    "6. ENSEMBLE → Combines all 3 models into weighted consensus\n",
    "7. SIGNAL GENERATION → BUY if bullish consensus, SELL if bearish, HOLD otherwise\n",
    "8. ORDER EXECUTION → Submits bracket orders to Alpaca API\n",
    "9. POSITION MONITORING → Tracks TP/SL and manages portfolio\n",

    "\n",
    "**Location**: `functions/trading_functions.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "- Downloads 200 days of historical data for a stock\n",
    "- Trains 3 independent forecasting models\n",
    "- Combines them into ensemble prediction\n",
    "- Generates trading signal with confidence score\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "result = unified_bayesian_gp_forecast(\"AAPL\")\n",
    "# Returns dict with:\n",
    "# - bayesian/gp/ensemble forecasts\n",
    "# - confidence levels\n",
    "# - final_signal: \"BUY\", \"SELL\", or \"HOLD\"\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 📘 **Model 1: Bayesian Linear Regression**\n",
    "- **Input Features**: Last 5 days' returns + volatility + RSI\n",
    "- **Method**: Weighted average of past patterns\n",
    "- **Output**: Expected return + uncertainty range\n",
    "- **Strength**: Fast, interpretable, handles noise well\n",
    "- **When it's useful**: Trending markets with clear momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📙 **Model 2: Gaussian Process**\n",
    "- **Input Features**: Last 10 days' returns only\n",
    "- **Method**: Non-parametric - learns smooth functions from data\n",
    "- **Output**: Expected return + uncertainty range  \n",
    "- **Strength**: Captures non-linear patterns, adapts to complexity\n",
    "- **When it's useful**: Choppy markets with regime changes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📕 **Model 3: RSI (Bayesian Interpretation)**\n",
    "- **Input**: 14-day RSI value\n",
    "- **Method**: Bayesian probability of BUY/SELL/HOLD\n",
    "- **Output**: Signal + probability distribution\n",
    "- **Strength**: Classic technical analysis with probabilistic twist\n",
    "- **When it's useful**: Mean-reversion plays, contrarian signals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensemble Logic**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Models are weighted by inverse uncertainty\n",
    "# More confident model = higher weight\n",
    "ensemble_forecast = (bayesian_weight * bayesian_pred + gp_weight * gp_pred) / total_weight\n",

    "- [ ] Install dependencies: `pip install yfinance alpaca-py pandas numpy scipy matplotlib python-dotenv tabulate`\n",
    "- [ ] Create `.env` file with Alpaca API keys\n",

    "### **Before Each Trading Session** ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Set `DRY_RUN = True` for testing\n",
    "- [ ] Define your `UNIVERSE` (start small: 3-5 stocks)\n",
    "- [ ] Configure risk: `TP_PCT`, `SL_PCT`, `MIN_CONF`\n",
    "- [ ] Check market hours: `trading.get_clock().is_open`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Daily Trading Workflow** ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [ ] **Scan**: `df = summarize_universe(UNIVERSE)`\n",

    "3. [ ] **Test**: `preview_signal(\"AAPL\")` for deep dive\n",
    "4. [ ] **Execute**: `run_once()` to place trades\n",
    "5. [ ] **Monitor**: Check positions throughout day\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Weekly Maintenance** ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Review performance (win rate, P&L)\n",
