    "- Downloads 200 days of historical data for a stock\n",
    "- Trains 3 independent forecasting models\n",
    "- Combines them into ensemble prediction\n",
    "- Generates trading signal with confidence score\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "result = unified_bayesian_gp_forecast(\"AAPL\")\n",
    "# Returns dict with:\n",

    "\n",
    "Before executing a trade, verify:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Confidence**: >= MIN_CONF (typically 0.65+)  \n",
    "✅ **Z-score**: >= 0.20 (statistical edge)  \n",
    "✅ **Probability Up**: >= 60%  \n",
    "✅ **Model Agreement**: 3+ models agree (Bayesian, GP, RSI, BB)  \n",
    "✅ **Bollinger Bands**: Position supports signal (oversold for BUY)  \n",
    "✅ **RSI**: Confirms direction (< 40 for BUY, > 60 for SELL)  \n",
    "✅ **Volume**: Above average (if available)  \n",
    "✅ **Sector Health**: Sector ETF also showing strength  \n",
    "\n",
    "If signal passes all checks → HIGH QUALITY trade  \n",
    "If signal fails 2+ checks → SKIP or wait for better setup\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "### **No BUY signals generated?**\n",
    "1. Lower MIN_CONF temporarily (try 0.60)\n",
    "2. Expand UNIVERSE (add more stocks)\n",
    "3. Check market conditions (bearish overall?)\n",
    "4. Review Bollinger Bands thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Too many losing trades?**\n",
    "1. Raise MIN_CONF to 0.70-0.75\n",
    "2. Increase MIN_Z to 0.30-0.40\n",
    "3. Widen TP_PCT to 0.05-0.06\n",
    "4. Reduce MAX_ORDERS to 3-4\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Drawdown too high?**\n",
    "1. Cut position sizes by 50%\n",
    "2. Tighten stop losses (SL_PCT = 0.015)\n",
    "3. Reduce MAX_ORDERS\n",
    "4. Take a break and review strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Win rate very high but not profitable?**\n",
    "1. Wins too small, losses too big (classic trap!)\n",
    "2. Widen TP/SL ratio (try 6%/2% or 8%/2%)\n",
    "3. Let winners run (consider trailing stops)\n",
    "4. Review actual fill prices vs expected\n",
